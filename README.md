# Ka Ching EA

This is the code for the Ka Ching EA, a forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is an innovative forex robot that uses market strength analysis and pivot points to open trading positions.

## Description

The Ka Ching EA is designed to analyze the strength of the market and identify pivot points to determine when to open trading positions. It uses a combination of technical indicators and calculations to make trading decisions.

The EA sets the take profit and stop loss levels based on predefined constants. The take profit level is set to 100 pips and the stop loss level is set to 50 pips. These values can be adjusted according to the trader's preferences.

The EA opens buy positions when the market strength is above 0.8 and pivot points are present. It opens sell positions when the market strength is below 0.2 and pivot points are present.

Once a trading position is opened, the EA performs necessary calculations to determine the entry price, take profit level, and stop loss level. It then executes the trade using the CTrade class from the Trade library.

The EA prints messages to the console to indicate when it is initialized, when a buy or sell position is opened, and when it is deinitialized.
